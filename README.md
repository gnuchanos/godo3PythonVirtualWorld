# godo3PythonVirtualWorld
This Python addon... the problem is not a performance issue. It's difficult to work with due to the main 
developer not reading through code examples, discussions, and issue reports. 
Furthermore, transitioning directly to Godot 4 without completing the addon for Godot 3.5 in over 6-7 years erodes its reliability in my eyes. 
Right now, it seems like a completely dead project - Godot Python
